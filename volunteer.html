    <p id="volunteer-info">Volunteer activities include reaching out to social platforms, fundraising, collecting food, and delivering to the food bank. All activities can be done based on your own pace and are safe during this pandemic. In the future, we plan to organize groups of students to volunteer at Second Harvest Food Bank.
      <br>
      <br>1. Student participants will schedule a time to donate through our email cansforkidsnc@gmail.com.
      <br>2. Each participant collects canned foods and sends the collected cans to a designated collecting location where all the cans are sorted by Cans for Kids. Receipts will be provided.
      <br>3. Cans for Kids will determine the volunteer hours based on the weight of cans that each student collects.
      <br>4. Each participant who donates cans will fill in the form on X2VOL on Naviance for Cans for Kids to approve.
      <br>5. Cans for Kids will deliver all the collected foods to the food bank and keep receipts for records.</p>
    <p id="volunteer-pounds">Every 15 pounds of food donated = 1 volunteer hour</p>
