          <p class="article-info">On February 25th, Cans for Kids initiated a campus-wide clean up event to pick up trash and litter throughout the Ardrey Kell campus.
             We were able to clean up the parking lots and the roadside, and the difference 
             is easily apparent. Thank you to all the volunteers who helped us make the school a cleaner and nicer place for all!

        <p class="article-header">Cans for Kids January Event</p>
        <p class="article-info">On January 20th, Cans for Kids donated 263 pounds of food to the Community House Middle School (CHMS) in order to support their new food pantry by working with Ballantyne Helping Neighbors in Need.
             This pantry was designed to bring aid to those in CHMS and
             their families who are in need of food. The food was collected over the course of 2 months and sorted by a group of volunteers
            before being brought to the pantry.
