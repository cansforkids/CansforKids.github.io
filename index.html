    <div id="section-info">
      <p id="section-desc" style="font-size: 14px">Cans for Kids was initiated by Jerry and Richard Lin 
        with two other Ardrey Kell high school students Joshua and Eric Cai in March of 2020. Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, 
        Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) has distributed millions of meals to 
        students in need. To contribute to these efforts, we collect non-perishable foods from our community and donate it 
        to help students during these troubling times. We officially became a school club in October of 2021 and we 
        continue to serve our community and provide volunteer opportunities to our students.</p>

    <p id="goals-header">Our Mission</p>
    <div id="section-info">
      <p id="goals-desc">Cans for Kids aims to aid children who have been less fortunate
         during the Covid-19 pandemic by helping them get daily meals. In addition to collecting
          food and drink donations, we provide volunteer opportunities to CMS students during our
           food drives and fundraisers. Through our value of students supporting their peers, we raise 
           awareness of the issues in our local community and encourage other students to step forward and
            make our community a better place.
