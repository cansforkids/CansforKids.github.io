    <div id="section-info">
      <p id="section-desc">Cans for Kids is a nonprofit organization created by four 
        high school students in April of 2020. Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, 
        Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) has distributed millions of meals to their 
        students in need. To contribute to these efforts, we decided to collect canned 
        goods and drinks from members of our community and donate it to help students 
        who do not have enough food in their homes, as well as to the families that 
        may have lost their jobs during these troubling times. </p>

    <p id="goals-header">Our Mission</p>
    <div id="section-info">
      <p id="goals-desc">Cans for Kids aims to aid children who have been less fortunate
         during the Covid-19 pandemic by helping them get daily meals. In addition to 
         collecting food and drink donations, we provide volunteer opportunities to CMS 
         students during our food drives and fundraisers. Through these efforts, we hope
          to encourage other students to step forward and make our community a better place.
