    <div id="section-info">
      <p id="section-desc" style="font-size: 13px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 20px;">Cans for Kids was initiated by Jerry and Richard Lin with two other Ardrey Kell high school students Joshua and Eric Cai in March, 2020. Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) has distributed millions of meals to students in need. To contribute to these efforts, we collect non-perishable foods from our community and donate them to help students during these troubling times. We officially became a volunteer-based school club in October of 2021 and registered as a non-profit organization in May, 2022. Cans for Kids continues to serve our community and provide volunteer opportunities to our students through means such as food drives, fundraisers, and other service events. </p>

    <p id="goals-header">Our Mission</p>
    <div id="section-info">
      <p id="goals-desc">Cans for Kids aims to aid children who are less fortunate by helping them get daily meals. In addition to collecting food and drink donations, we provide volunteer opportunities to CMS students during our food drives and fundraisers. Through our value of students supporting their peers, we raise awareness of the issues in our local community and encourage other students to step forward and make our community a better place.
