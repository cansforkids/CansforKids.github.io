            <div id="abouttext">
              <p id="content-about-text">Cans for Kids is a nonprofit organization created by four high school students in April of 2020. 
              Since the Covid-19 Pandemic began, Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools has distributed millions of meals to their students in need. 
              After realizing this situation, we decided to collect canned food from people in their community and 
              donate it to supply food for students who do not have enough of it in their households, and to the families that may have 
              lost their jobs during these troubling times.</p>

            <p id="content-goals-text">Cans for Kids aims to raise awareness about the CMS students who are struggling 
              to eat daily meals because of this Covid-19 outbreak and to encourage other CMS students to step forward to 
              assist them. Through donations from students, we would like to help feed those less fortunate and make our 
              community a better place to live.</p>
